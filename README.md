# Hello Full Stack (Angular + Node.js)

This project is a straightforward full-stack example using Angular 17 (standalone) on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. Itâ€™s Dockerized, cleanly structured, and built to actually run without wasting your time.

The app takes a name input in the browser and returns a custom greeting from the backend. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing fancy, but everything works end to end â€” good foundation for bigger things.

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- Angular 17 (standalone components, `HttpClient`, `FormsModule`)
- Node.js 22 + Express
- Docker multi-stage build
- Local dev with proxy config (no CORS headaches)

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Angular form to input a name
- Express POST endpoint at `/api/hello`
- Response: `Hello, {name}`
- Proxy config connects frontend to backend during development
- Docker build serves everything via Express in production

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Run locally with Node

# Backend
